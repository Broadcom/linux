Broadcom USB3 dual port phy for northstar2 SoC
This is a child bus node of "brcm,mdio-mux-iproc" node.

Required mdio bus properties:
- reg: MDIO Bus number for the MDIO interface
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Required PHY properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-usb3-phy"
- reg: Phy address in the MDIO interface
- usb3-ctrl-syscon: handler of syscon node defining physical address
  of usb3 control register.
- usb3-phy-cfg-syscon: handler of syscon node defining physical base
  address and length of usb3 phy config region.
- usb3-rst-ctrl-syscon: handler of syscon node defining physical base
  address and length of idm reset control of two ports.
- #phy-cells: must be 0
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Sub-nodes:
  Each port's PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
 - reg: the PHY number
 - phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 0

Required usb3 control properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-usb3-ctrl"
- reg: offset and length of the control registers

Required usb3 phy config properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-usb3-phy-cfg"
- reg: offset and length of the phy config registers

Required usb3 reset control properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,ns2-usb3-rst-ctrl"
- reg: offset and length of the reset control registers

Example:

mdio@1 {
	reg = <0x1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	usb3phy: usb3phy@0 {
		compatible = "brcm,ns2-usb3-phy";
		reg = <0x0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		usb3-ctrl-syscon = <&usb3_ctrl>;
		usb3-phy-cfg-syscon = <&usb3_phy_cfg>;
		usb3-rst-ctrl-syscon = <&usb3_rst_ctrl>;

		usb3phy0: usbphy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		usb3phy1: usbphy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
};

usb3_ctrl: syscon@6501d144 {
	compatible = "brcm,ns2-usb3-ctrl", "syscon";
	reg = <0x6501d144 0x4>;
