Broadcom iProc GPIO/PINCONF Controller

Required properties:

- compatible:
    "brcm,iproc-gpio" for the generic iProc based GPIO controller IP that
    supports full-featured pinctrl and GPIO functions used in various iProc
    based SoCs

    May contain an SoC-specific compatibility string to accommodate any
    SoC-specific features

    "brcm,cygnus-ccm-gpio", "brcm,cygnus-asiu-gpio", or
    "brcm,cygnus-crmu-gpio" for Cygnus SoCs

    "brcm,iproc-nsp-gpio" for the iProc NSP SoC that has drive strength support
    disabled

    "brcm,iproc-stingray-gpio" for the iProc Stingray SoC that has the general
    pinctrl support completely disabled in this IP block. In Stingray, a
    different IP block is used to handle pinctrl related functions

- reg:
  - Register set that define the base and range of the I/O address space that
contains SoC GPIO/PINCONF controller registers. Always present
  - Additional PINCONF registers. Present only for "brcm,cygnus-ccm-gpio",
"brcm,cygnus-crmu-gpio"

- ngpios:
    Total number of in-use slots in GPIO controller

- #gpio-cells:
    Must be two. The first cell is the GPIO pin number (within the
controller's pin space) and the second cell is used for the following:
    bit[0]: polarity (0 for active high and 1 for active low)

- gpio-controller:
    Specifies that the node is a GPIO controller

Optional properties:

- interrupts:
    Interrupt ID

- interrupt-controller:
    Specifies that the node is an interrupt controller

- interrupt-parent:
    Specifies an interrupt parent. The parent can be the mailbox controller if
    interrupt forwarding is being used. If this is the case then 'interrupts'
    must be 0 to specify the AON GPIO irq domain.

- #interrupt-cells:
    Must be two. The first cell is the GPIO pin number (within the controller's
    pin space) and the second cell is used to specify flags. See also
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt
    for more details.

- gpio-ranges:
    Specifies the mapping between gpio controller and pin-controllers pins.
    This requires 4 fields in cells defined as -
    1. Phandle of pin-controller.
    2. GPIO base pin offset.
    3  Pin-control base pin offset.
    4. number of gpio pins which are linearly mapped from pin base.

- brcm,pinconf-func-off:
    Certain iProc SoCs might have some of the PINCONF functions disabled in
the chip when the iProc GPIO controller is integrated. This optional property
allows unsupported PINCONF functions to be disabled

- mboxes:
    A phandle specifying the mailbox controller and channel used to communicate
    with the co-processor. This is required to configure a gpio pin as a wake
    source from sleep and deep sleep states.

Supported generic PINCONF properties in child nodes:

- pins:
    The list of pins (within the controller's own pin space) that properties
in the node apply to. Pin names are "gpio-<pin>"

- bias-disable:
    Disable pin bias

- bias-pull-up:
    Enable internal pull up resistor

- bias-pull-down:
    Enable internal pull down resistor

- drive-strength:
    Valid drive strength values include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 (mA)

- input-schmitt-enable:
    Enable schmitt-trigger mode

- input-schmitt-disable:
    Disable schmitt-trigger mode
