Broadcom AMAC Ethernet Controller Device Tree Bindings
-------------------------------------------------------------

Required properties:
 - compatible:	"brcm,amac"
		"brcm,amac-v2" - for v2 amac supporting WOL feature
		"brcm,nsp-amac"
		"brcm,ns2-amac"
 - reg:		Address and length of the register set for the device. It
		contains the information of registers in the same order as
		described by reg-names
 - reg-names:	Names of the registers.
		"amac_base":	Address and length of the GMAC registers
		"idm_base":	Address and length of the GMAC IDM registers
				(required for NSP and Northstar2)
		"switch_global_base": Address of the switch config register
		"nicpm_base":	Address and length of the NIC Port Manager
				registers (required for Northstar2)
 - interrupts:	Interrupt number

Optional properties:
- mac-address:	See ethernet.txt file in the same directory
- brcm,amac-switch-bypass:  This configuration is to by pass the internal
			    switch (if available). With the switch
			    disabled only Port 0 will function in those
			    SoC's.

Examples:

amac0: ethernet@18022000 {
	compatible = "brcm,nsp-amac";
	reg = <0x18022000 0x1000>,
	      <0x18110000 0x1000>;
	reg-names = "amac_base", "idm_base";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 147 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
