Broadcom IPROC DSI Controller driver
------------------------------
Overview
This is the brcm DSI controller driver for iProc SOC family
which hooks itself onto the Linux standard framebuffer framework
and receives user space ioctl commands. It configures the DSI,
AXIPV and PV hardware blocks which transports the framebuffer
contents onto the dsi panel attached.
A series of instructions/commands are sent to the panel in the form of
short/long packets during initialisation, suspend and resume.

Required properties:
- compatible		: "brcm,iproc-dsi"
- dsic-crmu-syscon	: phandle of dsic_crmu syscon register
- id			: Display ID
- reg			: Four register sets listed below.
			MIPI DSI PHY Register set
			MIPI AXIPV Controller Register set
			MIPI PV Controller Register set
			MIPI DSI GENERIC PLL Register set
			Register to generate software Controlled
			external device(panel) reset
- reg-names		: Values are "dsi-phy", "axipv", "pv", "gen-pll"
- interrupts		: Interrupts for DSI, AXIPV and PV.
- clocks		: DSI controller's clock registered to mipipll clock
			framework and the channel registered.
- clock-names		: DSI controller's clock name.
- brcm,num-fb		: Number of FrameBuffers used.
- brcm,iproc-mipi-reg-errata : Boolean entry, when set indicates that the
			dsi pll and phy register value corruption errata exist
			in this device. Due to this errata, write enable for a
			register is asserted for more than a cycle. So if
			address changes in the next cycle, same data can get
			written to another register. When this entry is set
			register is read back after every write if it falls
			in the errata address range. To make sure address stay
			constant for at least two cycles so that we will not
			be corrupting any other register.

Example:

	dsi {
		compatible	= "brcm,iproc-dsi";
		id		= <0>;
		brcm,num-fb	= <3>;
		reg 		= <0x180c0000 0x80>,
					<0x180a9000 0x60>,
					<0x180a9400 0x40>,
					<0x180a9800 0x50>,
					<0x0301d074 0x04>;
		reg-names	= "dsi-phy", "axipv", "pv", "gen-pll",
					"crmu_ext_reset";
		interrupts 	= <GIC_SPI 158 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
					<GIC_SPI 156 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
					<GIC_SPI 159 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks		= <&mipipll_clks 0>;
		clock-names	= "mipidsi_clk";
		brcm,iproc-mipi-reg-errata;
		status   	= "okay";
	};
